What is a writer? Merriam defines a writer as “one who writes” (Merriam-webster.com). I believe a writer is more than that. I believe a writer is somebody who stands up for their beliefs. A  writer tells their whole truth and nothing but their truth. A writer is willing to debate and research. A writer documents their surroundings. A writer makes their truth through their experiences. Throughout my experience as a writer, I have stood up for my truths. I’ve even kept an open mind and allowed my truths to change as I found research. As a writer, I’m able to be logical. I do not let my emotions interfere with retelling the truth. I stick to facts that back up my beliefs, and if the facts do not align with my beliefs, then I question my beliefs and allow them to change form.
