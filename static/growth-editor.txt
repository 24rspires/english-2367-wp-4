I think the most growth I’ve shown is as an editor. At the start of the school year, I hardly marked my peers' papers up at all. I’d maybe underline a sentence or two and throw in a short three-word comment following it. Now, I highlight whole sections of their papers and leave multiple-sentence comments. Sometimes, I’ll have so much feedback that I just mentally note where and what on their paper I need to talk to them about. Then, when I turn my edits in, I will flip through to those sections and tell them my feedback and how I think they can fix it so that they can ask me if they’re confused. It turns the peer edits into a conversational process rather than what I feel to be an isolated one. I always ensure my peers know they can approach me after I edit their paper with questions about my feedback because it’s essential to clarify any confusion.
