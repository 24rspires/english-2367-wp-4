	My most immense growth as a writer has been in my warrants. I’ve always struggled to come up with good warrants because, in my mind, a lot of the evidence is self-explanatory. I think this has changed a lot since August, when I started comp 1. My grades have reflected this, too. In comp 1, my WP #2 received a high 80. Then my WP #1 in comp 2 was a similar style paper but received a 91. My warrants have also gotten longer, but not necessarily more complicated. They’ve overall just gotten more put together and explanatory.
