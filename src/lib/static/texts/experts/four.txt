*Zen in the Art of Writing* states, “Quantity gives experience. From experience alone can quality come” (Temple). I disagree with this philosophy when it comes to writing. Writers must have a purpose before they start putting words on a page. If a writer does not have a clear purpose, the audience will leave their work confused. Writers cannot write just to write. There has to be a bigger, overlying purpose.
