Nabokov also states, “A good reader, a major reader, an active and creative reader is a rereader” (Nabokov). I agree with him completely. It’s great if somebody can understand something on their first read, but I guarantee they will find some deeper understanding or meaning if they reread the text again. It is impossible for anybody to get every single detail on their first read-through
