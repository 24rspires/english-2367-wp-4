Stephen King says in *On Writing*, “I was a teenager haunted by newspapers” (King). While he personally may have been haunted by newspapers, I do not believe it is necessary to be up to date on current events to be a good writer. Being up to date may help a writer connect with their audience; however, there are also timeless classics that can get this job done. I.E Star Wars, Titanic, Jaws. A writer just needs to be able to relate to their audience so that their audience can trust them.
