From *Good Readers and Writers*, by Vladimir Nabokov, “When this new world has been closely studied, then and only then let us examine its links with other worlds, other branches of knowledge” (Nabokov). Vladimir describes a fantastic writing habit that I wish I had known sooner. I will be implementing this in all of my writing from here on out. Vladimir says for writers to closely analyze their text in isolation before analyzing its connections to other texts. If somebody does not have the proper context for any of their references, they should still be able to at least piece together what they are saying. The writer should not be leaving their audience in the dust because they are unaware of a reference made.
