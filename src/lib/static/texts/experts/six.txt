McCann in *Letters to a Young Writer* states, “Don’t write what you know, write toward what you want to know” (Temple). McCann makes a very good point. If you want to practice writing but don’t have a purpose. Do a research paper. Really dive into a subject and write what you’ve learned about that topic.
