Delany states in their book about writing, “Either in content or in style, in subject matter or in rhetorical approach, fiction that is too much like other fiction is bad by definition” (Temple). I wholeheartedly agree with Delany. One is not a writer by copying others. Writing is about expressing yourself and your beliefs. You cannot do that by using somebody else’s voice. It’d be just like going to a concert, and instead of the main band playing, it’s just some random person lip-syncing to the band’s songs. It doesn’t make sense. Everybody has their own unique writing style, and they need to use it.
