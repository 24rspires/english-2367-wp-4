I really enjoyed this WP. I struggled a lot to sit down and focus on the writing aspect of the project rather than the creative part. I enjoy programming a lot, so I relished creating the website way more than writing the paper. Even halfway through building the website, I changed my development stack from the T3 stack to Sveltekit. I realize this won’t mean much for people who don’t know development, but it’s like changing shoes in the middle of the day to a more comfortable pair. The uncomfortable pair of shoes would’ve gotten through the day, but the comfy pair of shoes just makes everything easier. This WP is completely open-sourced, meaning you can find all the code [here](https://github.com/24rspires/english-2367-wp-4) to view plainly.
