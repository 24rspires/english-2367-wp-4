Do ask for help. There is no shame in getting help from peers, especially from the teacher. Mrs. Friece has helped immensely in my growth as a writer and editor. Do not be afraid of her (almost frightening) demeanor. She won’t bite you, I promise.
Do use a thesaurus. Nobody likes basic diction in writing. I get so bored at the end of a paper when I read “In conclusion…” Where’s the style? Where’s the pizzazz? Where’s the gumption? Look words up to add flare to your writing.
